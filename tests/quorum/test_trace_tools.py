# Codex review feedback P2 (2026-05-24): the four skill-* tools used to
# disagree about what counts as "skill invocation". skill-called and
# skill-not-called matched native Skill calls AND Bash reads of SKILL.md;
# skill-before-tool and skill-before-tool-match only matched the native
# form. So a Codex-driven run (which loads skills via Bash) would pass
# skill-called but fail skill-before-tool against the same trace.
# These tests pin the convergence — all four use the shared predicate.
