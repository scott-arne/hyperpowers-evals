It contains a feature request, the answers its author gave to clarifying
questions, and facts about the codebase.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different approaches for implementing it. Genuinely
different means different module structure, different state ownership, or a
different data model — not cosmetic variations of one shape. Respect the
decisions the author already made in their answers; do not re-litigate them.
Consider testability, behavior when browser storage is unavailable or holds a
corrupt value, and how the design extends to additional forms later.

Do not edit anything. This is read-only analysis.

Respond in exactly this shape:
