You are a stateless reviewer for this request only; do not load or read skill bootstraps or skills.

Read `approach-context.md` in this same directory. It contains an original feature request, the clarifying questions already answered by the human partner, and verified facts about a small codebase.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different viable architectures for the work described — not variations of a single shape. Consider how identity is obtained from the login API, where it is stored, how it is exposed to current and future consumers, how the login event is tracked, and how the existing synchronous `login` function and its single caller change.

Do not edit anything. This is read-only analysis.

Respond in exactly this shape:
