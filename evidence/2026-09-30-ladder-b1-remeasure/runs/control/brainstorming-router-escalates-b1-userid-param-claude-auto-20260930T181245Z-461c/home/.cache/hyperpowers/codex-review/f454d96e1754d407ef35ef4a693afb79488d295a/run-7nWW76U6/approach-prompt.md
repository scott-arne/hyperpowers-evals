It contains a feature request, the answered clarifying questions, and the
complete facts about a small codebase.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different architectures for implementing the requested
change — not variations of one shape. Consider where the network seam lives,
how the tracking call is structured and injected, how testability is achieved
given the file has no module boundary today, and what the function signature
and return contract become.

Do not edit anything. Read-only.

Respond in exactly this shape:
