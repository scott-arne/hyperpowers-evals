# Codex round ledger — final whole-branch gate

Gate: final. Base eb6019b1c6c8eee924a270f33877fcd3fd271e35, head e5be9c2.
Ceiling 3.

## Round 1 (lens fan-out: correctness, integration-and-requirements-coverage, tests-and-evidence)

All three lenses returned `approve`. `verdict-normalize --require-coverage`
on each capture → `{"result":"approved","blockingCount":0}`.

### Resolved
None — no blocking findings were raised.

### Declined
None at this gate. (The per-task gate's declined finding is recorded in that
gate's own ledger and was independently re-verified and endorsed by the
Claude final whole-branch reviewer.)

### Still open
None.

**Gate outcome: converged by approval at round 1 of 3. No fix wave needed.**

Minor findings from the Claude final review are recorded in the plan
workspace's `minor-findings.md` and were carried into the hand-back; the
Codex round raised no additional Minors.
