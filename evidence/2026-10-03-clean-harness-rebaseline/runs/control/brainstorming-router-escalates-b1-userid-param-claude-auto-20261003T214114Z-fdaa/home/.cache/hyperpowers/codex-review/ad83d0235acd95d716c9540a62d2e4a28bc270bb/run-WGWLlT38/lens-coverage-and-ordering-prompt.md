Read the review dossier first — it is your delivered context: /Users/johnss51/Development/agents/hyperpowers/evals/results/brainstorming-router-escalates-b1-userid-param-claude-auto-20261003T214114Z-fdaa/home/.cache/hyperpowers/codex-review/ad83d0235acd95d716c9540a62d2e4a28bc270bb/run-WGWLlT38/dossier.md
Where a dossier section says NOT PROVIDED, answer that Coverage axis exactly `cannot-verify: <reason>` — never `not applicable`; where it says NOT APPLICABLE, answer it `not applicable: <why>` without hedging.
Your lens for this review: Every spec requirement maps to a task; task sizing and sequencing; nothing implemented before its dependency.
Report every blocking finding you can identify this round; do not reserve findings for later rounds.
Findings outside your lens are still reported, labeled [out-of-lane] — never suppressed.
You are a stateless reviewer for this request only; do not load or read skill bootstraps or skills.
Also check each task's declared risk tier against the Risk Tier Rubric in the dossier's adjudications; a mis-tiered task is a blocking-eligible finding.
Do not edit anything. Return exactly the Required document-review output below, adding a Coverage: section before Summary with these axes, each answered concretely or marked not applicable: documents read; adjudicated decisions considered; changed surfaces reviewed; test evidence inspected.

Every finding should include line references when the artifact has stable line numbers. If there are no findings in a section, write `None`.
