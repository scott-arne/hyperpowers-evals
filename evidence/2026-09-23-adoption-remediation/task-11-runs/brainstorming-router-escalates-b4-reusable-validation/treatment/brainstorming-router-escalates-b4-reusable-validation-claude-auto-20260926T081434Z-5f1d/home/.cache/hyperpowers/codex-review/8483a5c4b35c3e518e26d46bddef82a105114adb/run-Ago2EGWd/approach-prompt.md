It describes a small static webapp and a request to make its form validation
reusable across multiple forms, along with the decisions already made with the
user (rule set, and the split between a pure validation core and an optional
DOM-binding layer).

Propose 2-3 genuinely different viable architectures for this — different
shapes, not variations of one shape. Consider, among other things, how
validation rules are expressed by a caller, how results are returned, how the
DOM layer discovers fields and renders messages, and how this fits a codebase
with no bundler and two conflicting module conventions.

Do not edit anything. Output only in this shape:
