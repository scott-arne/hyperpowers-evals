It describes a small browser application and a set of decisions its maintainer
has already made about adding production logging. Propose 2-3 genuinely
different approaches for how to structure that logging — different
architectures or data models, not variations of one shape. Respect the
decisions already recorded in the context (browser app only, third-party
service behind a first-party wrapper, allowlist plus hashed user id, npm plus
esbuild). Differ on structure: record shape, where redaction is enforced, how
uncaught errors are captured, how the vendor is isolated, and how the build
step lands.

Do not edit anything. This is a read-only consultation.

Respond in exactly this shape:
