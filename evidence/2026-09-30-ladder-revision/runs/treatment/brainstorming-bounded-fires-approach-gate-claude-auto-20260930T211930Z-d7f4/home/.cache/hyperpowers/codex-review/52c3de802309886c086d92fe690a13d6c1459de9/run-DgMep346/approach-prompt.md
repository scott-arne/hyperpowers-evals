It describes a small JavaScript change: adding a `truncate` option to an
existing `format(str, options)` function. Propose 2-3 genuinely different
viable approaches for implementing it — different algorithms or option shapes
with materially different tradeoffs, not cosmetic variations of one shape.
Consider the cut strategy (hard cut vs word boundary vs something else), the
option's shape in the API, how it composes with the existing prefix/suffix
options, and edge cases such as a max length at or below the length of the
ellipsis.

Do not edit anything. This is read-only analysis; output your answer as text.
