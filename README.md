# Superpowers Evals

Behavioral eval lab for [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). The
**Harness** drives real coding-agent CLIs (Claude, Codex) through a Gauntlet
QA agent and grades them against scenario acceptance criteria plus
deterministic post-checks.

This is not a generic benchmark suite. It is an eval lab for workflow
compliance: skill triggering, worktree behavior, subagent coordination,
verification reflexes, review quality, and cost-shaping patterns.

> **Legacy:** Drill — the previous tmux-based runner — is being removed. Its
> usage notes are parked at [docs/drill-legacy.md](docs/drill-legacy.md) until
> the code is deleted. New scenarios go through the Harness.

## Safety Model

The Harness has two very different execution modes:

- **Static/unit checks** are safe for public CI. They run `ruff`, `ty`, and
  `pytest`. They do not call model APIs and do not launch agent CLIs.
- **Live evals** are trusted-maintainer operations. They launch Claude Code or
  Codex CLI in permissive modes and collect raw transcripts, tool calls,
  filesystem state, and session logs.

Public CI must stay on the static/unit side of that line. Never add API keys,
live `harness run …` invocations, or dangerous-mode agent launches to public
CI.

## Live Eval Risk

Live evals run the Coding-Agent under test with broad execution power:

- Claude uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- Codex uses `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

The Harness seeds a fresh per-run agent-config dir (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for
Claude, `CODEX_HOME` for Codex) so the Coding-Agent never sees the host's real
`~/.claude` / `~/.codex`, installed plugins, or prior sessions. That narrows
the blast radius but is not a sandbox — the subprocess still inherits the
parent shell environment and can read exported credentials.

Run live evals only from a trusted local environment:

- Export only the API key needed for the selected Coding-Agent.
- Avoid running with broad production or personal secrets in the environment.
- Treat `results-harness/`, raw session logs, and Gauntlet-Agent inputs as
  sensitive.
- Do not commit or paste raw run artifacts without checking them first.

## Quick Start

Install:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Run one scenario:

```bash
uv run harness run harness/scenarios/triggering-writing-plans --coding-agent claude
```

List scenarios:

```bash
uv run harness list
```

Scaffold and validate a new scenario:

```bash
uv run harness new my-new-scenario
uv run harness check my-new-scenario
```

`harness check` with no arguments validates every scenario.

Run the full matrix:

```bash
uv run harness run-all --coding-agents claude,codex --jobs 2
```

`run-all` runs every scenario against every Coding-Agent, filtered by each
scenario's `# coding-agents:` directive. View the resulting matrix with
`uv run harness show <batch-id>`.

## Canonical Actors

Keep the actors straight; confusing them is the most common triage error.
These names are used everywhere — docs, CLI output, code, filenames, commit
messages.

| Actor | What it is | Where it lives / its files |
|---|---|---|
| **Gauntlet** | General-purpose QA framework; the `gauntlet` CLI. A black-box tester. | repo `~/Code/prime/gauntlet`; on `PATH` as `gauntlet` |
| **Gauntlet-Agent** | The LLM *inside* Gauntlet that drives the Coding-Agent and self-grades against the story's ACs. | model e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`; event stream → `<run>/gauntlet-agent/results/<runId>/run.jsonl`; verdict → `result.{json,md}` |
| **Coding-Agent** | The agent under test — the SUT. Instances: **Claude**, **Codex**; future **Gemini**, **Pi**. | session log → `<run>/coding-agent-config/…`; the files it writes → `<run>/coding-agent-workdir/` |
| **Harness** | The Python wrapper. Owns setup, Coding-Agent adaptation, deterministic checks, and the final verdict. | repo `superpowers-evals/harness/`; `<run>/verdict.json` |

A run involves **two** LLMs — the **Gauntlet-Agent** (QA tester) and the
**Coding-Agent** (subject). Separate models, separate logs, separate token
costs.

## Scenario Anatomy

A scenario is a directory under `harness/scenarios/<name>/`:

```text
story.md    Gauntlet story — the QA agent's brief + acceptance criteria
setup.sh    builds the fixture workdir (runs before the Coding-Agent)
checks.sh   deterministic checks — pre() + post() bash functions
```

`story.md` carries YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`) and an
`## Acceptance Criteria` section. Write criteria to demand log evidence
(e.g. "a `Skill` invocation naming `superpowers:writing-plans` appears in the
Coding-Agent's session log") so the Gauntlet-Agent must consult the log, not
just the screen.

### `checks.sh` Format

`checks.sh` is a bash script containing exactly two functions — `pre()` and
`post()` — and nothing else at the top level:

```bash
# coding-agents: claude,codex   ← optional; restricts which agents run this scenario
pre() {
    git-repo
    git-branch main
}

post() {
    file-exists "docs/plan.md"
    skill-called superpowers:writing-plans
}
```

`pre()` runs after `setup.sh`, before the Coding-Agent starts. `post()` runs
after the Coding-Agent's session is captured. The optional
`# coding-agents: <csv>` magic comment restricts which Coding-Agents the
scenario is valid for; omit it to allow all agents.

Scripts must have **no exec bit** and contain only function definitions.
Invoke check tools by name — they are on `PATH` via `harness/bin/`.

### Check Vocabulary (`harness/bin/`)

Every tool emits one JSON record per invocation. A non-zero exit means the
check failed; the record carries a `detail` string explaining why.

**Artifact surface** — the filesystem the Coding-Agent produced:
- `file-exists <glob>` — a path matching the glob exists.
- `file-contains <path> <regex>` — the file exists and matches the regex.
- `command-succeeds <cmd>` — the command, run in the Coding-Agent's workdir, exits 0. Use for project build/test commands (`go test ./…`, `npm test`), not as a substitute for `file-contains`.

**Git surface** — git state the Coding-Agent shaped:
- `git-repo` — the workdir is a git work tree.
- `git-branch <name>` — current branch equals name; use `detached` for detached HEAD.
- `git-clean` — the working tree has no uncommitted changes.
- `git-count worktrees|commits <op> <n>` — the count satisfies the comparison (`eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`).

**Trace surface** — the Coding-Agent's normalized tool-call log (`coding-agent-tool-calls.jsonl`):
- `tool-called <tool>` — the tool appears in the trace at least once.
- `tool-count <tool> <op> <n>` — the call count satisfies the comparison.
- `tool-before <a> <b>` — tool `a` was called before tool `b`.
- `tool-arg-match <tool> <jq>` — at least one call to `tool` has args matching the jq filter.
- `tool-match-before-tool-match <tool-a> <jq-a> <tool-b> <jq-b>` — a matching call to `a` precedes a matching call to `b`.
- `skill-called <skill>` — a `Skill` invocation names the given skill.
- `skill-not-called <skill>` — no `Skill` invocation names the given skill.
- `skill-before-tool <skill> <tool>` — the skill was invoked before the tool.
- `skill-before-tool-match <skill> <tool> <jq>` — the skill was invoked before a matching call to `tool`.

**Negation:**
- `not <check> [args…]` — runs the inner check without emitting a record, inverts the result, and emits one negated record. Always use `not` rather than bash's bare `!`.

The shared `_record` helper (sourced by every tool) handles record emission and
an `ERR` trap so a crashing tool never silently drops out of the verdict.

## Verdict

The Harness produces a **three-valued verdict** — `pass | fail | indeterminate`:

- `pass` — Gauntlet-Agent passed **and** every post-check passed.
- `fail` — Gauntlet-Agent failed, or a post-check failed.
- `indeterminate` — a pre-check failed (invalid fixture), Gauntlet-Agent returned `investigate`, the capture was empty while a trace check was present, or the Harness itself errored. An `indeterminate` run is not a finding — it is a signal that the run did not execute cleanly.

The structured `verdict.json` (schema v1) contains:

- `gauntlet` layer — `status`, `summary`, `reasoning`, `run_id`.
- `checks` layer — an array of records from `pre()` and `post()`, each with `check`, `args`, `negated`, `passed`, `detail`, `phase`.
- `final` — the composed `pass | fail | indeterminate`.
- `final_reason` — a human-readable explanation of the verdict.
- `error` — present if the Harness itself threw; includes `stage` and `message`.

**Exit codes:** 0 = pass, 1 = fail, 2 = indeterminate.

## Run Directory Layout

Each run produces one directory under `results-harness/`, with every entry
prefixed by the actor it belongs to:

```text
results-harness/<scenario>-<coding-agent>-<timestamp>/
├── verdict.json                     the composed result — the front door
├── gauntlet-agent/                  the Gauntlet-Agent's evidence
│   └── results/<runId>/
│       ├── result.{json,md}         the Gauntlet-Agent's verdict
│       ├── run.jsonl                the Gauntlet-Agent's event stream
│       ├── inputs/story.md
│       └── captures/
├── coding-agent-workdir/            the Coding-Agent's file output
├── coding-agent-config/             the Coding-Agent's isolated config home
├── coding-agent-tool-calls.jsonl    the Coding-Agent's normalized trace
└── coding-agent-token-usage.json    the Coding-Agent's token cost
```

`results-harness/` is gitignored because run artifacts can contain sensitive
transcripts.

## Coding-Agents

A Coding-Agent is one agent CLI under test. Its config is
`harness/coding-agents/<name>.yaml`; its companion HOWTO,
`harness/coding-agent-contexts/<name>/HOWTO.md`, is prose the Gauntlet-Agent
reads to learn how to launch and observe that CLI. Both are authored once per
CLI and shared across scenarios.

| Coding-Agent | CLI | Required environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Claude Code | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SUPERPOWERS_ROOT` |
| `codex` | Codex CLI | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SUPERPOWERS_ROOT` |

When this repo is checked out as `superpowers/evals`, the Harness defaults
`SUPERPOWERS_ROOT` to the parent `superpowers` checkout. In a standalone
`superpowers-evals` clone, set it explicitly:

```bash
export SUPERPOWERS_ROOT=/path/to/superpowers
```

Use a different `SUPERPOWERS_ROOT` when running RED/GREEN comparisons against
modified superpowers skill text.

Note: Gauntlet's own `gauntlet` CLI preserves its `--target <binary>` flag for
selecting the TUI adapter binary; the Harness's `--coding-agent` flag is a
separate, higher-level concept that selects the agent config.

## How a Run Works

A `harness run` drives one scenario against one Coding-Agent:

1. **Coding-Agent config** — `harness/coding-agents/<name>.yaml` is parsed and
   its required env vars validated.
2. **Run dir** — a per-run directory is created under `results-harness/`. It
   doubles as Gauntlet's `--state-dir` root and the evidence root.
3. **Isolation** — a fresh per-run agent-config dir (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for
   Claude, `CODEX_HOME` for Codex) is seeded from a skeleton, so the
   Coding-Agent never sees the host's real `~/.claude` / `~/.codex`, installed
   plugins, or prior sessions.
4. **Setup** — the Coding-Agent's workdir is created inside the run dir as
   `coding-agent-workdir/`; the scenario's `setup.sh` builds the fixture.
5. **Pre-checks** — `checks.sh`'s `pre()` runs against the workdir; a failure
   marks the run `indeterminate` before the Coding-Agent is launched.
6. **Context** — the per-agent HOWTO (`harness/coding-agent-contexts/<name>/`)
   is copied into the run's `gauntlet-agent/context/` so the Gauntlet-Agent
   learns how to launch and observe the Coding-Agent.
7. **Drive** — `gauntlet run story.md --adapter tui --state-dir gauntlet-agent`
   launches. The Gauntlet-Agent reads the screen and the Coding-Agent's session
   log via bash, role-plays the user, and issues a verdict against the story's
   `## Acceptance Criteria`.
8. **Capture** — the Coding-Agent's session-log dir is diffed, normalized into
   `coding-agent-tool-calls.jsonl`, and token usage is written to
   `coding-agent-token-usage.json` (measurement only).
9. **Post-checks** — `checks.sh`'s `post()` runs against the captured evidence.
10. **Compose** — the final verdict is `pass` iff the Gauntlet-Agent passed
    **and** every post-check passed. `verdict.json` is written to the run dir.

## Writing a Scenario

1. `uv run harness new <name>` stamps a structurally-valid skeleton.
2. Write `story.md`: brief the Gauntlet-Agent on the role it plays, the exact
   message to send the Coding-Agent, and when it is done — plus
   evidence-demanding acceptance criteria. Follow the
   `writing-gauntlet-stories` skill.
3. Write `setup.sh` to build the fixture. Prefer
   `uv run setup-helpers run <helper>` over inline Python; if you need a new
   fixture, add a helper to `setup_helpers/` and register it in
   `setup_helpers/__init__.py`.
4. Write `checks.sh` with `pre()` and `post()` functions using the
   `harness/bin/` vocabulary. No exec bit.
5. `uv run harness check <name>` to validate structure, then run it against a
   Coding-Agent.

Setup scripts run with `$HARNESS_WORKDIR` pointing at the fixture workdir.
Check tools run from the fixture workdir with `harness/bin/` on `PATH`.
Post-checks that need sibling run artifacts can use `$HARNESS_RUN_DIR`.

## Refreshing the Claude Skeleton

The dialog-bypass skeleton at `fixtures/skeleton-claude-home/` is committed —
fresh checkouts, worktrees, and CI runners boot Claude straight to the prompt
with no per-machine setup. It carries only the ~12 universal dialog-bypass
flags (`hasCompletedOnboarding`, `installMethod`, migration markers, etc.);
the refresh script scrubs all per-user, per-machine, and per-key fields before
writing.

Refresh only when Claude Code adds new onboarding state (a previously-skipped
picker reappearing in a tmux attach is the usual symptom):

```bash
# 1. Run Claude with a fresh config dir; click through every dialog with your
#    real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY active. Once you reach the prompt, /exit.
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/claude-source claude

# 2. Rebuild the fixture; commit the diff.
bin/refresh-skeleton-claude-home --source /tmp/claude-source
git diff fixtures/skeleton-claude-home/   # sanity-check the scrubbed result
git commit fixtures/skeleton-claude-home/ -m "harness: refresh Claude skeleton"
```

Codex needs no skeleton — `_seed_codex_auth` provisions a fresh per-run home
from your `OPENAI_API_KEY` each run.

## Safe Checks

These are the checks expected in CI and on routine PRs:

```bash
uv run ruff check
uv run ty check
uv run harness check
uv run pytest
```

## Triage

Triaging a non-passing run: `uv run harness show [<target>]` and see
[docs/superpowers/skills/triaging-a-failing-eval.md](docs/superpowers/skills/triaging-a-failing-eval.md)
for the attribution atlas.

For the current known-good baseline (what counts as a clean batch on
this commit, per backend), see [docs/baselines/](docs/baselines/).

## Contribution Rules

This repo inherits the quality bar of `superpowers`.

- One problem per PR.
- Do not commit generated run artifacts or secrets.
- Do not add live evals to public CI.
- Use the PR template and explain the security/eval-lab risk for changes that
  touch Coding-Agent configs, shell execution, setup helpers, check tools, or
  Gauntlet-Agent input.
- Changes to behavior-shaping eval methodology need evidence, not just prose.

## Parent Submodule Bump

`superpowers-evals` is consumed by `superpowers` as the `evals` submodule.
After any PR merges to `main` here, open a follow-up PR against the parent
`superpowers` repo targeting `dev` that bumps the `evals` submodule pointer to
the merged `superpowers-evals` commit.

Do not treat a `superpowers-evals` merge as fully propagated until that parent
submodule bump PR exists.
