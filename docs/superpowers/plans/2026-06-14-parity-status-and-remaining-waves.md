# ATIF graft + TS↔Python parity — status & remaining plan (RESUME DOC)

> Written 2026-06-14 to survive a context compaction. If you're resuming cold, read this top-to-bottom first. It captures branch state, what's merged, the in-flight Wave 2b, the remaining Wave 3, the review/finish steps, and the conventions every wave follows.

## ⏩ RESUME HERE — 2026-06-15 (session 2; read this first)

Branch `ts-python-parity` has grown FAR past "parity": ATIF graft + parity + live-eval hardening + **economics-on-ATIF** + tooling. Tip `6ce2029` (or later). `atif-graft` still `21f1a8a` (its own PR). Gate: **983 pass**. `quorum check` green.

**DONE this session (all merged + pushed to ts-python-parity):**
- **Live coverage: 8/8 agents PASS** a real smoke (`00-quorum-smoke-hello-world`, run with serf `.env` sourced inline + `SUPERPOWERS_ROOT=/Users/jesse/git/superpowers/superpowers`, `--out-root` OUTSIDE SUPERPOWERS_ROOT). Fixes that got there: codex app-server stdin-grace (`sh -c '{ cat; sleep 3; } | codex app-server'`), antigravity clean-staged plugin + `dot:true` capture glob, copilot via `gh auth token`, pi+kimi **oauth-or-env** auth (kimi binary `~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi` via PATH; needs `kimi login` on host), codex/antigravity plugin-copy excludes root `evals`+`.claude`.
- **ATIF-usage unification** (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-atif-usage-unification.md`): all 8 normalizers fill `AtifStep.metrics`/`final_metrics` (DISJOINT buckets: prompt=UNCACHED input, cached=cache_read, cache_write in extra, completion=output[+reasoning]); economics prices the trajectory via the **obol `atif` dialect** (`estimateTrajectory`→`estimatePath(traj,"atif")`); **deleted** `src/obol/fallback.ts` + per-agent `DIALECTS`/`estimateSessionLogs` raw-log parsing. Evergreen per-format doc: `docs/superpowers/reference/atif-normalizers.md` (incl. the **single-source invariant** — each agent reports usage in ONE place; copilot was a hybrid → final_metrics-only). Token math VERIFIED twice (arithmetic audit + native-log cross-check, all 8 MATCH).
- **Live ATIF-sourced coding-$ matrix:** claude 55K/$0.11, codex 31K/$0.08, gemini 34K/$0.06, opencode 52K/$0.13, copilot 144K/$0.11, pi 20K/$0.06, kimi 57K/**unpriced**, antigravity **null** (agy emits no usage — honest). 7/8 captured, 6/8 priced.

**obol `atif` dialect:** lives in `/Users/jesse/git/prime-radiant-inc/obol` branch `atif-dialect` (pushed). ts-python-parity's `package.json` points `@primeradianthq/obol` at a LOCAL tarball `file:.../obol/dist-pack/primeradianthq-obol-0.5.0-atif.1.tgz`. **Before shippable: publish obol 0.5.0 + repoint the dep** (explicit step WITH Jesse).

**IN FLIGHT (background subagent — merge when it lands; disjoint files → clean):**
- `rfix-bin-cleanup` (agent `a52662dd`): the bin/ TS-dispatcher cleanup per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-bin-check-tool-architecture.md` — kill `bin-ts/`, check tools → TS, `scripts/` for maintenance, preserve record/negation/127-crash-band invariants. LARGE; may land partial-but-green. Touches bin/, src/check/, src/checks/index.ts, src/cli/index.ts, src/setup-step.ts, scripts/. When it lands: `cd` to the parity worktree, `git merge --no-ff origin/rfix-bin-cleanup`, `bun install && bun run check && bun run quorum check`, push, delete branch, prune its worktree, reset atif-graft drift.
- DONE this session: `rfix-costs-batch` (merged `6ce2029`) + the read-only cross-check (`a6f4c8fc`, all 8 token numbers verified faithful to native logs, no branch).

**REMAINING (in order):**
1. Merge `rfix-bin-cleanup` when it lands (steps above).
2. **Per-run `$HOME` isolation** (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-per-run-home-isolation.md`) — do AFTER bin/ (they share the env-composition layer: setup-step, runner gauntlet env, launch-agents, PATH).
   - **DECISION (Jesse 2026-06-15): the thing that matters is THE CODING AGENTS run in an isolated `$HOME`. No flag — unconditional for ALL 8 agents-under-test.** Out of scope (leave on REAL home): the **gauntlet drive** (no W2) and **`setup.sh`** (no W6 → no fixture-cache re-download problem). Overrides the spec's phased flag + C2-exempt plan. Keep quorum's own credential reads on REAL home (free on Bun — `os.homedir()` snapshots `$HOME` at startup; never `setProcessEnv('HOME')` on quorum itself).
   - **antigravity (a coding agent → in scope) → C1 mandatory.** agy reads a live rotating OAuth token from `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` at the subprocess's own `$HOME`; throwaway `$HOME` with no seed breaks agy auth. So SEED `oauth_creds.json`+`google_accounts.json` (read from REAL home / `AGY_OAUTH_HOME`) into throwaway `$HOME/.gemini`. The keyring entry is NOT home-relative (macOS Keychain is per-login-user) → survives. **Verify at impl** whether agy's `--gemini_dir` already covers the oauth read (if so, seeding into `--gemini_dir` suffices and the HOME pin is harmless); do NOT guess the agy read path.
   - **Grounded coordinates** (`src/runner/index.ts`, verified 2026-06-15): runDir = `allocateRunDir(...)` @774; configDir/workdir + `mkdirSync(workdir,{recursive:true})` @966-968 — **W1: add `const runHomeDir = join(runDir,'home'); mkdirSync(runHomeDir,{recursive:true});` right after @968** (run-dir-relative → reaped with the run; thread `homeDir: runHomeDir` into the `home`/`RunHome` object @969 for the provisioning-subprocess overlay W5). substitutions map @1100 — **W4: add `$QUORUM_AGENT_HOME` = runHomeDir (+ `_SH`)**, plus a single `$QUORUM_HOME_ENV` fragment token = already-quoted `HOME=… XDG_CONFIG_HOME=… XDG_CACHE_HOME=… XDG_DATA_HOME=… XDG_STATE_HOME=… TMPDIR=…` (always populated; no off state). **W3 launchers** — the un-pinned ones (`coding-agents/{claude,gemini,pi,antigravity}-context/launch-agent`): claude+pi use `exec env … cmd` (quoted `VAR="$VAR"`); gemini uses `exec env \` + unquoted `$VAR_SH` lines — inject the `$QUORUM_HOME_ENV` fragment into each `exec env` line. codex/copilot/opencode/kimi already pin HOME (don't double-set; verify their XDG coverage so all 8 are uniformly isolated).
   - Tests: every coding-agent launcher (incl. claude/gemini/pi/antigravity) contains literal runHomeDir; credential-source anchoring (mutate `process.env.HOME` mid-test → codex/gemini/agy reads still hit real home / `*_AUTH_HOME` override); config-dir vars (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`GEMINI_CLI_HOME`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`/`ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR`) NOT displaced; agy oauth seeded into throwaway `.gemini`.
3. kimi-code pricing — **PUNTED** (add a rate to obol later; "add to obol, per-token if a public rate exists").
4. obol publish + dep repoint; then the eventual PR(s) — branch scope is now huge, discuss slicing with Jesse.

**Directive shift (still in effect):** "ignore python parity in favor of making good, working software." **Hazards:** isolation:'worktree' fan-outs move LOCAL `atif-graft` onto parity commits (reset it: `git -C <atif-graft-worktree> reset --hard origin/atif-graft`); the Bash cwd can reset to the atif-graft worktree (always `cd` to the parity worktree first); run-all skips draft scenarios unless `--include-drafts`. **Security:** I leaked `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` via a bad `${VAR:-UNSET}` echo — Jesse rotating at end of evening; NEVER interpolate a secret into output.

## TL;DR
Two stacked branches off `origin/main` (Matt's TS rewrite of the `quorum` eval harness, which still carries the Python original):
- **`atif-graft`** — the ATIF graft: purge Python, make ATIF v1.7 the canonical transcript (`trajectory.json`), replace the 13 `bin/` trace tools with one `check-transcript` CLI, + cleanup. Converged & green, its own PR. ~27 commits over main.
- **`ts-python-parity`** (branched off `atif-graft`) — closes the TS-vs-Python parity gaps from `~/2026-06-14-ts-python-parity-punchlist.md` (147 findings). **75 fixes merged so far** (Wave 1 + Wave 2a), gate green. **Wave 2b (the runner) is IN FLIGHT.**

Ground truth for "is X a real parity gap" = the **flat-JSONL Python frozen on `origin/main`** (`git show origin/main:quorum/<f>.py`), NOT the ATIF Python on other branches.

## Branches & worktrees
- `origin/main` — Matt's TS rewrite (`src/`) + the frozen Python (`quorum/`, `setup_helpers/`). The parity target.
- `atif-graft` @ `21f1a8a` — checked out at the MAIN session worktree `…/evals/.claude/worktrees/atif-graft`. Pushed. Its own PR (ATIF graft + purge + cleanup).
- `ts-python-parity` @ `c06a51d` (at write time) — checked out at the nested worktree `…/evals/.claude/worktrees/atif-graft/.claude/worktrees/parity`. Pushed. Do parity merges/commits HERE.
- `feat/atif-port` — the original ATIF port (under `ts/`); REFERENCE ONLY for heavy module ports (`git show feat/atif-port:ts/src/quorum/<x>.ts`). Untouched.
- Gates (run in the parity worktree): `bun run check` (biome+tsc+test) and `bun run quorum check`. Baseline at write time: **795 pass / 0 fail, 55 scenarios ok.**

## DONE
- **ATIF graft** (`atif-graft`): purge Python, ATIF capture (`trajectory.json` + multi-log carry-forward merge), `check-transcript <verb>` CLI (13 verbs), composer guard, converged via 2 review rounds (629 pass).
- **Wave 1** (28 fixes): leaf subsystems — normalizers, checks, cli, run-all, scaffold, setup-helpers.
- **Wave 2a** (47 fixes): all 8 agent provisioning modules (codex/gemini/copilot/claude/kimi/opencode/antigravity/pi) + capture/obol detectors + session `duration_ms` + economics. Heavy module ports (opencode-capture, agy-creds/teardown/watch, kimi sanitization, timing) cribbed from `feat/atif-port`. Exported building blocks for the runner (e.g. `writePrivateFileNoFollow`, `scanCopilotSecretLeaks`, opencode snapshot/export, agy modules, misplaced-session detectors).
- Fix commits: `git log --oneline origin/main..origin/ts-python-parity` (messages `fix(parity): <ID> …`).

## DONE — Wave 2b (the runner) + its review fixes
- **MERGED** `p2b-runner` → `ts-python-parity` at **`85be220`** (`--no-ff`), gate green (836 pass, 55 scenarios). It wired every Wave-2a building block + the A-core findings: REGION 1 early guards, REGION 2 gauntlet result tolerance, REGION 3 per-agent wiring (copilot env-allowlist/secret-scan/session-id; opencode snapshot/export; antigravity watcher/creds/launch-cwd/settings), REGION 4 post-capture cascade, REGION 5 economics crash-guard. `H-kimi-batch-preflight` intentionally NOT ported (parent-side batch preflight; out of scope, confirmed clean). `p2b-runner` remote branch deleted; stale local `p2-*` branches pruned.
- **Pre-merge adversarial review found 2 real gaps, both now fixed (TDD):**
  - **F1 (HIGH)** `24a8bb4` — copilot was missing from `STRICT_CAPTURE_NAMES`; an empty/zero-row copilot run was scored pass/fail instead of indeterminate. Added `copilot` to the strict floor (copilotCascadeVerdict still runs first, matching Python order). `test/runner-cascade.test.ts`.
  - **F2 / RX-6 (MEDIUM, secret leak)** `de0ad57` — kimi runtime-env mode-0600 secret temp dir was never reaped. Added `runtimeCleanupDirs` + `cleanupAgentRuntime` + a `runInner` try/finally (parity with Python `_cleanup_agent_runtime`; cleanup-failure → setup indeterminate). `test/runner-cleanup.test.ts`. **This closes RX-6.**
  - Known narrow residual (flagged, not fixed): a kimi provision that THROWS between writing the secret file and returning isn't covered by the runner finally (Python guards it with an internal try/except in `_seed_kimi_config`). Rare; untestable without heavy provision mocking. Optional follow-up.
- Gate after both fixes: **844 pass, 55 scenarios ok**, pushed `de0ad57`.

> NOTE on a hazard that was found & fixed: the Wave 2b worktree agent's `git reset --hard` had moved the **local** `atif-graft` branch forward to the parity commits (origin/atif-graft was untouched at `21f1a8a`). Left alone, a stray `git push` from the atif-graft worktree would have fast-forwarded the PR branch with parity commits. Local `atif-graft` was reset back to `origin/atif-graft`.

## WAVE 3 — the net-new LOW findings (from the colleague reconciliation, `~/2026-06-14-reconciled-missing-findings.md`)
**WAVE 3 DONE** — RX-1..6 all landed (`e323677` for RX-1..5 in `src/contracts/agent-config.ts`; RX-6 in the Wave 2b fixes). All are CodingAgentConfigError → setup indeterminate; `loadAgentConfig` is called only from the runner so `quorum check` is unaffected.
- **RX-1** ✅ `runtime_family` defaults to name, must be a known family (validate-only; returned shape unchanged since readers already default via `?? name`).
- **RX-2** ✅ claude family requires a model; any declared model must be non-blank.
- **RX-3** ✅ `name == file-stem`.
- **RX-4** ✅ `required_env` set at load time (present-but-empty counts as missing).
- **RX-5** ✅ `substituteEnv` now also does bare `$VAR` + `$$`→`$`; new `resolveSessionLogDir` substitutes then expands leading `~`; runner uses it.
- **RX-6** ✅ closed by F2 (`de0ad57`).
- Intentionally SKIPPED (sanctioned divergence): Python's "non-Claude variants not supported in v1" check — TS is multi-agent and the rule is redundant for every real config (runtime_family == name).
- Borderline (NOT done, skip unless asked): `run-dir-collision-tolerance` (`mkdir exist_ok=False` vs `recursive:true`) — real but no realistic exposure.

## CONSOLIDATED REVIEW — DONE (fixes merged at `03e7c91`, 884 pass)
Ran `/par` (2 competing adversarial reviewers) + `roborev review --branch --base atif-graft` (job 1066) + collated earlier open roborev (1062/1063). Earlier roborev: all addressed except the kimi launch-subs gap (1063#1), which was fixed here. Fixed ALL confirmed findings via an 8-group disjoint-file fan-out (TDD, merged sequentially, branches+worktrees cleaned):
- **H1** kimi `$KIMI_ENV_FILE`/`$KIMI_BINARY` launch substitutions wired (was unwired → live kimi aborted under `set -u`). `kimiLaunchSubstitutions` helper in runner.
- **H2** kimi preflight secret leak — `sanitizeKimiDiagnostic` was dead code; now wraps `KimiAgent.provision` so no raw `KIMI_MODEL_API_KEY` reaches `verdict.json`.
- **H3** `command -v <bin>` probes (copilot/gemini/opencode/pi/kimi) → `Bun.which` (the builtin-not-an-executable bug false-failed Linux provisioning).
- **H4** `setup.sh` >1 MB output → `maxBuffer: Infinity` (ENOBUFS was mislabeled a spawn failure).
- **M1** opencode timeout was swallowed as success (`exitCode ?? 0`) → `spawnOutcome` decision + `OpenCodeTimeoutError`, preflight aborts on first timeout.
- **M2** copilot leak-scan followed symlinked dirs (`statSync`) → `lstatSync`, no symlink descent.
- **M3** agy-teardown lexical path match → realpath both sides (tmux 429-kill was missing on macOS `/tmp`→`/private/tmp`).
- **L1** `quorum new foo/bar` story id; **L2** copilot/gemini `~` expansion of SUPERPOWERS_ROOT; **L3** runPhase `maxBuffer`; **L5** story-meta `splitlines`; **L6** antigravity git-path exit check.
- **L4** signal-killed pre()/post() → CRASH regardless of records (`54ef2fc`). Jesse's call: a killed phase is never "clean". Deliberate divergence from Python (records still surfaced; exit lands in the ≥128 crash band).
- A notable pattern: the impactful new findings clustered in **live-eval agent paths** (kimi/copilot/opencode/antigravity) that are mock-tested, not driven live — which is why unit gates missed them. → motivates the live-eval-tests phase.

> **DIRECTIVE SHIFT (2026-06-15):** Jesse — "ignore python parity in favor of making good, working software." From here, decisions optimize for correctness, not matching Python. (Ratifies L4 + the codex/antigravity copy fixes, which already left Python behind.)

## ⚠️ RECURRING HAZARD — local `atif-graft` drift
Every `isolation:'worktree'` agent fan-out has moved the LOCAL `atif-graft` branch forward onto parity commits (its `git reset --hard origin/ts-python-parity` moves whatever branch the agent worktree was based on). `origin/atif-graft` stays correct at `21f1a8a`. **Before any atif-graft PR work, run:** `git -C <atif-graft-worktree> reset --hard origin/atif-graft`. A stray `git push` from that worktree would FF-contaminate the PR branch with parity commits.

## LIVE EVAL TESTS — coverage status (smoke `00-quorum-smoke-hello-world`, out-root OUTSIDE SUPERPOWERS_ROOT)
Goal (Jesse): prove CLEAN live coverage of EVERY harness. Run with serf `.env` sourced inline (never echoed) + `SUPERPOWERS_ROOT=/Users/jesse/git/superpowers/superpowers`. Validated pipeline = provisioning → gauntlet → ATIF capture → checks → economics → verdict.
- ✅ **claude** PASS (full economics) · ✅ **gemini** PASS · ✅ **opencode** PASS · ✅ **antigravity** PASS (after the two fixes below; trajectory captured)
- ⚠️ **codex** — copy fixes VERIFIED (clears the staged-copy + self-copy guard); now blocked at **codex 0.133.0 app-server: responds to `initialize` (id 1) but NOT `hooks/list` (id 2)** → `no response for request 2`. NOT auth (`~/.codex/auth.json` present, initialize answered). Likely 0.133.0 protocol drift — app-server may now require an `initialized` notification before further requests, or `hooks/list` was renamed/changed. NEEDS protocol research against codex 0.133.0 (`src/agents/codex-app-server.ts:buildHandshakeInput`); do NOT guess the protocol.
- ⛔ **pi** / **kimi** / **copilot** — need Jesse's interactive env (my Bash shell lacks `PI_*`, `KIMI_MODEL_API_KEY`, `kimi-code` on PATH, and a GH token). RX-4 correctly gates pi/kimi here. kimi binary fixed → `kimi-code`. Run these in Jesse's shell to prove coverage.
- Economics — coding-agent token capture for gemini/opencode/antigravity (ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED 2026-06-15, see `docs/experiments/2026-06-15-coding-agent-token-capture.md`):
  - **gemini** & **opencode**: tokens ARE in the captured logs (gemini per-turn `tokens{input,output,cached,thoughts}`; opencode `messages[].info.tokens`), but obol's `gemini`/`opencode` dialects return ZERO on these CLI versions (format drift). FIX: quorum-side token summer `src/obol/fallback.ts` (`sumCodingAgentTokens`), wired as a fallback in `estimateSessionLogs` after obol returns null. coding_agent now carries real token counts; model left UNPRICED (`est_cost_usd: null`) since obol can't price it → `partial` stays `true` honestly.
  - **antigravity**: NOT fixable from what agy writes. obol has no `antigravity` dialect AND agy's `transcript.jsonl`/`transcript_full.jsonl` contain NO token/usage fields anywhere in its config tree (the only token data in an agy run is the gauntlet-agent's own `usage.jsonl`). Capturing agy coding-agent tokens requires agy itself to emit usage, or a usage-bearing sidecar we don't yet have. `coding_agent: null` / `partial: true` is the honest outcome until then.
  - Behavioral eval is CLEAN for all three (PASS + trajectory).
- Fixes landed for live coverage: kimi.yaml `binary: kimi-code` + codex exclude-evals + self-copy guard (`a2a5758`, merged `180b44c`); antigravity clean staged plugin (exclude root `evals`+`.claude`, keep `.claude-plugin`) + capture `dot:true` glob so `**` descends agy's `.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl` (`f150905`).
- ⚠️ **Incident:** accidentally echoed the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` value into the transcript via a bad `${VAR:-UNSET}` expansion. Jesse: rotate at end of evening. Never interpolate a secret var into output.

## PLANNED — per-run custom `$HOME` (Jesse, 2026-06-15)
"We're going to eventually need to at least set a custom `$HOME` for every single eval run." The robust isolation primitive: every agent reads home-relative global state (`~/.gemini`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, `~/.config`, keyrings) which leaks personal state in and makes runs non-hermetic. A throwaway per-run `$HOME` would isolate all of it at once and subsumes a whole class of findings (agy reading global gemini state, codex auth seeding, etc.). Not yet implemented — design + wire `$HOME=<run>/home` (or a mkdtemp) into every agent launch + the gauntlet drive.

## LATER — finish
0. **Finish live coverage** in Jesse's env: codex (`hooks/list` protocol research), pi/kimi/copilot (keys). Codify a `live-smoke` runner (`quorum run-all --scenarios 00-quorum-smoke-hello-world --coding-agents <all> --out-root /tmp/... --jobs 1`).
2. **Finish / PRs** (confirm strategy with Jesse): `atif-graft` → `main` is its own PR (ATIF graft + purge + cleanup). `ts-python-parity` → stacked on it (clean linear descendant: merge-base == atif-graft tip, 0 divergent). Show Jesse the diffs before opening. Per repo `CLAUDE.md`: one problem per PR; disclose agent authorship.
3. **Parent submodule bump**: after a merge to `main` here, open the follow-up PR in the parent `superpowers` repo (target `dev`) bumping the `evals` submodule pointer.

## CONVENTIONS every wave follows
- **Cosmetic-skip policy** (do NOT fix): numeric rounding mode (banker's vs half-up), error-message wording, exit-code NUMBER (1 vs 2), key ordering, whitespace/padding/wrapping/truncation, non-ASCII escaping. Fix everything with behavioral/correctness/security/crash impact.
- **Sanctioned divergences** (intentional, NOT gaps — see punch list lines 30-37): the scheduler (`--jobs` default 1→8, `launch_spacing_seconds`), `bin/` check tools staying bash, JSON-formatting-only diffs, no `src/agents/claude.ts` (claude is the YAML default), the new `src/dashboard/` + `src/scheduler/`.
- **Parallel-fan-out pattern** (Wave 1/2a were `Workflow` runs; honor Jesse's "use a workflow, max parallelism, strict TDD"): one isolated-worktree agent per DISJOINT-file group; each `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/ts-python-parity && bun install`, TDD each finding (failing test first), `bun run check` + `bun run quorum check` green, `git push origin HEAD:p<wave>-<group> --force-with-lease`, return structured {branch,status,fixed,skipped,gate}. Then the controller merges the branches into `ts-python-parity` (disjoint files → clean), re-gates, pushes, deletes the merged `p*` branches, prunes the leftover `wf_*` worktrees.
- **The runner (`src/runner/index.ts`) is the serialization point** — never fan out parallel agents against it; do runner work in ONE agent (or sequentially). That's why Wave 2b is a single agent.
- **Re-derive normalizer (D-*) findings** against `src/normalize/*.ts` (our ATIF normalizers ≠ Matt's deleted flat `src/normalizers/`); several D-* are not-applicable or TS-is-safer — don't "fix" TS into matching a Python crash.
- After each wave: clean up `p*` branches (`git push origin --delete …`) and leftover workflow worktrees (`git worktree remove --force …/wf_*`; `git worktree prune`).

## KEY ARTIFACT LOCATIONS
- Our audit: `/Users/jesse/2026-06-14-ts-python-parity-punchlist.md` (147 findings; sections by subsystem with Python+TS refs + line ranges).
- Reconciled net-new: `/Users/jesse/2026-06-14-reconciled-missing-findings.md` (the 6 RX lows).
- Colleague audits (already reconciled — mostly dup/out-of-scope): `/Users/jesse/yesterday-session-findings.md`, `/Users/jesse/2026-06-14-ts-python-parity-punchlist (1).md`.
- ATIF graft spec/plan (on `atif-graft`/`ts-python-parity`): `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-atif-graft-onto-quorum-ts.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-14-atif-graft-and-cleanup.md`.
- Workflow scripts persisted under `…/workflows/scripts/ts-python-parity-wave1-*.js` and `…-wave2a-*.js` (editable + re-runnable via `Workflow({scriptPath})`).
- Standing constraints: don't push to `main`; pushes to our feature branches are authorized ("push whenever you commit"); live `quorum run` evals are trusted-maintainer only (never in public CI); `.env` for keys lives at `/Users/jesse/git/prime-radiant-inc/serf` (source inline, never echo into transcript).
