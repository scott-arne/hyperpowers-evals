It contains a feature request, the answers its human partner gave to
clarifying questions, and facts about the codebase. Propose independent
approaches for the design described under "What to produce".

Do not edit anything. This is read-only: produce only the output below.

Constraints that are already settled and must not be re-litigated: ES
modules, and a rules-only boundary with no DOM involvement.

Apply YAGNI ruthlessly — this is a tiny zero-dependency project with exactly
one form today and no second form planned. Prefer the smallest design that
still earns the word "reusable". Note explicitly if you think an approach is
over-engineered for this codebase.
