"""Kill gauntlet's private named-socket tmux server for a given run.

Gauntlet drives agy inside a per-session tmux server addressed by a randomly
chosen named socket (`gauntlet-<epoch>-<rand>`).  The name is chosen at
runtime inside gauntlet — quorum cannot pre-compute it.  Killing the
launcher's process group does NOT reap agy because tmux reparents panes to
PID 1; only `tmux -L <name> kill-server` does (gauntlet's own teardown path).

Discovery strategy: glob the tmux socket dir for `gauntlet-*` sockets, then
query each server for its pane cwd.  The server whose pane path resolves to
exactly the run's scratch directory is THIS run's server.  Equality on resolved
paths (not substring) guards against false-matching a sibling directory such as
`scratch-extra`.
