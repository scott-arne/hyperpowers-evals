It describes a small JavaScript utility and a requested feature: a truncate
option for an existing `format(str, options)` function.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different viable approaches for designing and
implementing that truncate option. Differ on real design axes — the option's
shape and API contract, the truncation algorithm, how the ellipsis is
accounted for, and where truncation sits among the existing transforms — not
on cosmetic variations of one shape. Note edge cases each approach must
handle and how each interacts with the existing option-ordering behavior.

Do not edit anything. Read-only analysis and prose output only.

Respond in exactly this shape:
