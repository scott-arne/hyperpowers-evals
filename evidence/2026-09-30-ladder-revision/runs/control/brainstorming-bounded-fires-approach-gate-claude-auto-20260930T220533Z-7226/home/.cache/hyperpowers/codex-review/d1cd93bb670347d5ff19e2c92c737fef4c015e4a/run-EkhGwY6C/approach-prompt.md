It describes a small change to a JavaScript string-formatting utility: adding a
truncate option. Two decisions are already fixed by the human partner and are
NOT open for you to revisit — truncation runs last (after prefix/suffix), and
the `'...'` counts inside the `maxLength` budget. Design within those.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different approaches for the open question: how the cut
point is chosen, and what the resulting option surface and edge-case behavior
should be. Approaches should differ in substance, not in naming. Consider edge
cases the context does not settle, such as very small `maxLength` values,
strings with no word boundary before the budget, and whitespace left at the
cut.

Do not edit anything. This is a read-only advisory request.
