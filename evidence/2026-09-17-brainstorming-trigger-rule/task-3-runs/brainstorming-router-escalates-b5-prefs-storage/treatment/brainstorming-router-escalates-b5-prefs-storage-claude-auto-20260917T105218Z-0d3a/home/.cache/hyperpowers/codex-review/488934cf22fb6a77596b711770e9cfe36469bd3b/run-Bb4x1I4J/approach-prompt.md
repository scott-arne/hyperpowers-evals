It describes a small codebase and a feature request: add user preferences
storage to a browser page so UI settings persist across sessions, including
one preference wired end to end.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different approaches — different data models, module
boundaries, or architectures, not cosmetic variations of one shape. Weigh how
preferences are declared/defaulted/validated, the module boundary given the
page loads plain classic scripts with no build step, behavior when storage is
unavailable or corrupt, and how the stored shape evolves as preferences are
added.

Do not edit anything. Read-only.

Respond in exactly this shape:
