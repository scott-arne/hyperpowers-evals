You are a stateless reviewer for this request only; do not load or read skill bootstraps or skills.

Read `approach-context.md` in this same directory. It contains an original feature request, the clarifying questions already answered by the human partner, and complete listings of every file in a very small repository.

Propose 2-3 genuinely different approaches for the design problem stated at the end of that file. "Genuinely different" means different architectures, data models, or module shapes with materially different tradeoffs — not three variations of one shape.

Respect the decisions already made in the clarifying answers (shared app state, per-tab `sessionStorage` persistence, classic script with a namespaced global rather than ES modules). You may flag a decision as questionable in a tradeoff line, but do not build all your approaches on overturning it.

Do not edit anything. Output only the following shape:
