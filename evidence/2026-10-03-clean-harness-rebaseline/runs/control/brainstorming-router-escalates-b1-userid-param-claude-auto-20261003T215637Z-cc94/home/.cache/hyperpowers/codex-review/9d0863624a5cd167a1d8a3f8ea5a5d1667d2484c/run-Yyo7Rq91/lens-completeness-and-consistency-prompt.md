Read the review dossier first — it is your delivered context: /Users/johnss51/Development/agents/hyperpowers/evals/results/brainstorming-router-escalates-b1-userid-param-claude-auto-20261003T215637Z-cc94/home/.cache/hyperpowers/codex-review/9d0863624a5cd167a1d8a3f8ea5a5d1667d2484c/run-Yyo7Rq91/dossier.md
Where a dossier section says NOT PROVIDED, answer that Coverage axis exactly `cannot-verify: <reason>` — never `not applicable`; where it says NOT APPLICABLE, answer it `not applicable: <why>` without hedging.
Your lens for this review: Every requirement present, unambiguous, and internally consistent; contradictions and gaps between sections.
Report every blocking finding you can identify this round; do not reserve findings for later rounds.
Findings outside your lens are still reported, labeled [out-of-lane] — never suppressed.
You are a stateless reviewer for this request only; do not load or read skill bootstraps or skills.
Do not edit anything. Return exactly the Required document-review output below, adding a Coverage: section before Summary with these axes, each answered concretely or marked not applicable: documents read; adjudicated decisions considered; changed surfaces reviewed; test evidence inspected.

### Required document-review output

Every finding should include line references when the artifact has stable line numbers. If there are no findings in a section, write `None`.
